# About
This application allows users to retrieve and display nutritional information about various food items by entering their unique FDC ID. It integrates with an API that fetches food data from the USDA FoodData Central database. The app ensures proper error handling, robust state management, and clear display of results.

# Features
Fetch nutritional data for a food item using its FDC ID.
Displays key details, including calories, macronutrients, and other important nutritional information.
Handles missing or null values gracefully.
Provides error messages if the API call fails.
Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

# Usage
Enter an FDC ID in the input field.
Click the "Fetch Data" button.
View the nutritional information for the food item.
If the data is unavailable or the FDC ID is invalid, an appropriate error message will be displayed.

# Future Enhancements
- Search by Food Name: Add functionality to search by food name instead of FDC ID.
- History Tracking: Maintain a list of previously searched items.
- Improved UI: Enhance the UI for a better user experience with charts or graphs for nutritional data.
- Pagination: Support paginated results for larger datasets.
